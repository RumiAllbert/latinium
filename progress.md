## 2025-03-21: Major Architectural Refactoring - Direct API Integration

### Summary
Completely overhauled the application architecture by removing the Netlify Functions layer and implementing direct client-side integration with Google's Gemini API.

### Changes
- Created a new `directGeminiApi.ts` utility for direct client-side API calls
- Added text processing utilities for handling API responses
- Created a demo page showcasing the direct API approach
- Simplified project structure by removing unnecessary serverless functions
- Updated configuration to support public environment variables
- Created comprehensive documentation on the direct API approach

### Motivation
The Netlify Functions approach was causing persistent timeout issues with the 10-second default limit for serverless functions. The direct client-side approach eliminates these timeout problems, simplifies the architecture, and improves debugging capabilities.

### Benefits
- Eliminated timeout issues by removing the serverless layer
- Simplified deployment and maintenance
- Improved performance by removing the middle layer
- Enhanced debugging capabilities with all code running in the browser
- Reduced complexity of the overall application

### Technical Details
- Added appropriate CORS handling and security considerations
- Implemented proper timeout management on the client side
- Added graceful fallback to mock data when the API is unavailable
- Created a parallel implementation to allow users to choose between direct API or Netlify Functions

### Next Steps
- Monitor performance and user feedback on the direct API approach
- Consider completely removing the Netlify Functions implementation if the direct approach proves more reliable
- Add API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console to limit usage to our domain
